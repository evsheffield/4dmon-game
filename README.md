4dmon-game
==============

When all hope is lost and the 'X' button won't even work, we need a hero. We need... 4DMON!

###Setup

Install Phaser and other components by running `bower install`.

You can use any webserver you like for development, but cool people tend to
use [buttle](https://github.com/jtrussell/buttle). Just run `buttle` from the project root. 
The `.buttlerc` file is already set up to open the correct page and use live reloading.

###How to Play

`WASD` for movement

###Roadmap

**For v1.0**

- 4dmon's attacks
- Basic enemies
- Game screens
- Assets

**Going further...?**

- Multiple attack types for 4dmon
- Snazziness and particle effects
