4dmon-game
==============

When all hope is lost and the 'X' button won't even work, we need a hero. We need... 4DMON!

###Setup

Install Phaser and other components by running `bower install`.

You can use any webserver you like for development, but cool people tend to

The `.buttlerc` file is already set up to open the correct page and use live reloading.

###How to Play

`WASD` for movement
